## Replacing document in MongoDB

### replaceOne()
```js
db.collection.replaceOne(filter, replacement, options)
```

To replace documents in MongoDB, we use the *replaceOne()* method. The *replaceOne()* method takes the following parameters:

    filter: A query that matches the document to replace.
    replacement: The new document to replace the old one with.
    options: An object that specifies options for the update.

In the previous video, we use the _id field to filter the document. In our replacement document, we provide the entire document that should be inserted in its place. Here's the example code from the video:

```js
db.books.replaceOne(
  {
    _id: ObjectId("6282afeb441a74a98dbbec4e"),
  },
  {

```


In this activity, we will use the MongoDB shell to replace a document while keeping the original document's _id field.

You are now connected to an Atlas cluster and the bird_data database. Use the birds collection for this lab.
Lab Instructions

    Find the document with a common_name of Northern Cardinal and take note of the _id field.

    Use the _id from Step 1 to create a query that will replace the Northern Cardinal document with the following document:
```js
{
  "common_name": "Morning Dove",
  "scientific_name": "Zenaida macroura",
  "wingspan_cm": 37.23,
  "habitat": ["urban areas", "farms", "grassland"],
  "diet": ["seeds"],
}
```
Verify that the operation was successful. A successful replacement will return the following output:
```js
{
   "acknowledged": true,
   "insertedId": null,
   "matchedCount": 1,
   "modifiedCount": 1,
   "upsertedCount": 0
}
```
