# updateMany()
Takes 3 arguments 
- Filter document
- Update document
- Options object

The method returns an output messsage showing the number of matched and modified documents.

```js example
db.books.updateMany(
  {
    year: 2002
  },
  {
    $set:{
      instock: true
    }
  }
)
```

updateMany() is Not an all-or-nothing operation means <strong> When the operation fails it will not autometically roll back update we have to run that operation again (_updateMany()_).</strong>

It also lacks isolation when the changes are done they will be visible as soon as they are performed.

That's why updateMany() is not appropriate for some use cases like bank transaction records.

## Lab
Imagine youâ€™re working with a research who asked you to update the last_seen field value of the birds collection for a few different species at once.

    Update the last_seen date to 2022-01-01 for Blue Jay and Grackle in the birds collection.

```js
db.birds.updateMany(
  {
    "common_name":{
      $in:["Blue Jay","Grackle"]
    }
  },
  {
    $set:{
      "last_seen": ISODate("2022-01-01"),
    }
  }
)
```
