# Projections

When we want to display the data when there are too many fields the result beckomes messy to avoid so we can use the projections which displays only those fields which we want to see.

```js example
db.inspections.find(
  {
    sector:"Restaurant"
  },
  { // This is projection area
    business_name:1,
    result:1
    // The result will only contain the _id, business_name and the result fields.

    // We can hide the _id field to by using the option.
    _id:0 // We want to exclude this field
  }
)
```
It is important that you cannot use Inclusion and Exclusion statements combines together in the projections only the _id is exception.




To specify fields to include or exclude in the result set, add a projection document as the second parameter in the call to db.collection.find().

Syntax:

```js
db.collection.find( <query>, <projection> )
```

Include a Field

To include a field, set its value to 1 in the projection document.

Syntax:

```js
db.collection.find( <query>, { <field> : 1 })
```

Example:

```js
// Return all restaurant inspections - business name, result, and _id fields only
db.inspections.find(
  { sector: "Restaurant - 818" },
  { business_name: 1, result: 1 }
)
```

Exclude a Field

To exclude a field, set its value to 0 in the projection document.

Syntax:

```js
db.collection.find(query, { <field> : 0, <field>: 0 })
```

Example:

```js
// Return all inspections with result of "Pass" or "Warning" - exclude date and zip code
db.inspections.find(
  { result: { $in: ["Pass", "Warning"] } },
  { date: 0, "address.zip": 0 }
)
```

While the `_id` field is included by default, it can be suppressed by setting its value to 0 in any projection.

```js
// Return all restaurant inspections - business name and result fields only
db.inspections.find(
  { sector: "Restaurant - 818" },
  { business_name: 1, result: 1, _id: 0 }
)
```
