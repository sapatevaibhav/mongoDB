## Finding documents by using Logical operators

`and` `or`

Find a Document by Using Implicit *$and*

Use implicit *$and* to select documents that match multiple expressions. For example:
```js
db.routes.find({ "airline.name": "Southwest Airlines", stops: { $gte: 1 } })
```
Find a Document by Using the *$or* Operator

Use the *$or* operator to select documents that match at least one of the included expressions. For example:
```js
db.routes.find({
  $or: [{ dst_airport: "SEA" }, { src_airport: "SEA" }],
})
```
Find a Document by Using the *$and* Operator

Use the *$and* operator to use multiple $or expressions in your query.
```js
db.routes.find({
  $and: [
    { $or: [{ dst_airport: "SEA" }, { src_airport: "SEA" }] },
    { $or: [{ "airline.name": "American Airlines" }, { airplane: 320 }] },
  ]
})
```

In this lab, youâ€™ll find every sale which contains every item with a writing tag or a name of pens.

You are now connected to an Atlas cluster and to the sample_supplies database. Use the sales collection in this lab.

Return every document in the sales collection that meets one of the following criteria:
Item with the name of pens
Item with a writing tag
```js
db.sales.find({
  $or: [{ "items.name": "pens" }, { "items.tags": "writing" }],
})
```
