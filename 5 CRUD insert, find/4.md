## Querying on Array elements

`elemMatch` - For elements from Aarray matches specific criteria.

In the following example, "InvestmentFund" is not enclosed in square brackets, so MongoDB returns all documents within the products array that contain the specified value.
```js
db.accounts.find({ products: "InvestmentFund"})
```
Find a Document by Using the `$elemMatch` Operator

Use the `$elemMatch` operator to find all documents that contain the specified subdocument. For example:

```js
db.sales.find({
  items: {
    $elemMatch: { name: "laptop", price: { $gt: 800 }, quantity: { $gte: 1 } },
  },
})
```

#### Example

Using the *transactions* collection, search for all accounts with a `"sell"` transaction which amounts to less than or equal to *$4500*. Note that the transactions field includes a sub document with an amount for each transaction and a transaction code of either sell or buy.

You are now connected to an Atlas cluster and to the sample_analytics database. Use the transactions collection in this lab.
Lab Instructions

Create a query that matches all documents with a transactions sub document that contains an amount less than or equal to $4500 and a *transaction_code* of `"sell"` in the transactions collection. 

```js
db.transactions.find({transactions:{$elemMatch:{"amount":{$lte: 4500},"transaction_code":"sell"}}})
```
