# Inserting a Document in Node.js Applications

Review the following code, which demonstrates how to insert a single document and multiple documents into a collection.

## Insert a Document

To insert a single document into a collection, append insertOne() to the collection variable. The insertOne() method accepts a document as an argument and returns a promise. In this example, the document that's being inserted is stored in a variable called sampleAccount, which is declared just above the main() function.
```js
const dbname = "bank"
const collection_name = "accounts"
 
const accountsCollection = client.db(dbname).collection(collection_name)

const sampleAccount = {
 account_holder: "Linus Torvalds",
 account_id: "MDB829001337",
 account_type: "checking",
 balance: 50352434,
}

const main = async () => {
 try {
   await connectToDatabase()
   // insertOne method is used here to insert the sampleAccount document
   let result = await accountsCollection.insertOne(sampleAccount)
   console.log(`Inserted document: ${result.insertedId}`)
 } catch (err) {
   console.error(`Error inserting document: ${err}`)
 } finally {
   await client.close()
 }
}
 
main()
```

## Insert Many Documents

To insert more than one document, append the insertMany() method to the collection object, and then pass an array of documents to the insertMany() method. The insertMany() method returns a promise. We await the promise to get the result of the operation, which we then use to log the number of documents that are inserted to the console. In this example, the accounts to be inserted are stored in an array variable called sampleAccounts. This variable is defined just above the main() function.
```js
const dbname = "bank"
const collection_name = "accounts"
 
const accountsCollection = client.db(dbname).collection(collection_name)

const sampleAccounts = [
 {
   account_id: "MDB011235813",
   account_holder: "Ada Lovelace",
   account_type: "checking",
   balance: 60218,
 },
 {
   account_id: "MDB829000001",
   account_holder: "Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi",
   account_type: "savings",
   balance: 267914296,
 },
]
 
const main = async () => {
 try {
   await connectToDatabase()
   let result = await accountsCollection.insertMany(sampleAccounts)
   console.log(`Inserted ${result.insertedCount} documents`)
   console.log(result)
 } catch (err) {
   console.error(`Error inserting documents: ${err}`)
 } finally {
   await client.close()
 }
}

main()
```

### Questions

1. You need to insert a new restaurant into the restaurants collection. The new restaurant document is stored in the variable named hyderabadiBiryani. A reference to the collection is stored in a variable called restaurants. Which of the following expressions will insert the new document into the restaurants collection? (Select one.)
```js
let result = await restaurants.insertOne(hyderabadiBiryani)
```

2. You need to add documents for the 5 new neighborhoods in the neighborhoods collection. A reference to the neighborhood collection is stored in a variable called neighborhoodsCollection. Documents for each new neighborhood are stored in the neighborhoodUpdate variable. Which expression should you use to insert these documents into the collection? (Select one.) 
```js
let result = await neighborhoodsCollection.insertMany(neighborhoodUpdate)
```
