# Working with MongoDB documents

**BSON** 
Optimized for storage, retrival, and transmission across the wire.

BSON is more secure than plain text JSON which is vulnarable for the JSON injection attacks.

BSON also supports more datatypes than that of JSON.

**Documents**
Documents are the foundational organizing principle of storing data in MongoDB because they provide flexible and concise data representation.


BSON-encoded documents are converted automatically by the driver. This means that you can use the data immediately in your application as normal JSON and access properties by using dot notation. The driver handles the conversion from BSON to JSON for you.
