## Scaling data model

We need 
Optimum efficiency of:
Query result times
Memory usage
CPU usage
Storage

Avoid unbounded documents (Infinitely growing documents)


### Problems as the array grows larger

- It will take up more space in memory.
- May impact write performance.
- Difficult to perform pagination of comments
- Maximum doxument size of 16 MB will lead to storage problems.
