# Embedding Data in Documents

Used when you have one-to-many or many-to-many relationships in the data that's being stored.

e.g.
```json
{name:
  {
    firstName:"Vaibhav",
    lastName:"Sapate"
  }
}
```

### Pros:
Avoids application joins.
Provides better performance for read operations.
Allows developers to update related data in a single write operation.

### Warning:
Embeddong data into a single document can create large documents.

Large documents have to be read into memory in full, which can result in a slow application for your end user.

Continuously adding data without limit creates unbounded documents.

unbounded documents may exceed the BSON document threshold of 16 MB.

## Why embedding?

- Store related data in a single document.
- Simplify queries and improves overall query performance
- Ideal for one to many and many to many relationships among data
- Has pitfalls like large and unbounded documents.
