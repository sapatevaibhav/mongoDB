Schema design patterns are guidelines that help developers plan, organize, and model data.

#### Schema anti pattern results
- Sub-optimal performance
- Non-scalable solutions

#### Common schema anti-patterns
- Massive arrays
- Massive number of collections
- Bloated documents
- Unnecessary indexes
- Queries without indexes
- Data that's accessed together, but stored in different collections.

The Schema Anti-Patterns tab from Data Explorer  highlights any issues in the collection and provides details to resolve them. You can improve your schema by resolving the anti-patterns that are shown.
