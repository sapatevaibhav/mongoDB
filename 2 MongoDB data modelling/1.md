Defining how data is stored is one function of data modeling. Data modeling helps you use your data effectively to meet information needs.

Defining the relationships that exist among different entities in your data is one function of data modeling. Data modeling enables you to document data requirements for applications and identify errors in development plans before any code is written.

A proper data model makes it easier to manage your data. It will sustain growing data volumes and adjust easily to the addition or deletion of data.

A proper data model makes queries more efficient. It helps developers understand the database and tune it for fast performance, which makes reading and writing to the database faster.

A proper data model uses less memory and CPU. Data modeling helps you better estimate and model memory requirements.

A proper data model can reduce costs by using your database more efficiently. Data modeling catches errors and oversights early, when they are easier to fix.

The document model does not enforce any document structure by default. This means that documents, even in the same collection can have different structures.
