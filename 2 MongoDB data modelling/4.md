## References

When you are using 2 or more collections to store data and want to ensure that those collections are related we use references.

It save the _id field of one document in another document as a link between the two.

They are simple and sufficient for most use cases.
Using references is called linking or data normalisation

### advantages
- No duplication of data
- Smaller documents

### disadvantages
- Querying from multiple documents costs extra resources and impacts read performance.
