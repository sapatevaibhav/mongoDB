# Introduction to MongoDB

**The database** is the core of MongoDB's developer data platform. It is a multi-cloud database service built for resilience, scale, and the highest levels of data privacy and security.

**MongoDB Atlas Search** is an embedded full-text search that gives you a seamless, scalable experience for building relevance-based app features.

**Application Services** are cloud services that simplify building applications with Atlas.

**Data Federation** allows you to natively query, transform, and move data across AWS S3 and MongoDB Atlas clusters.

**A MongoDB Atlas Cluster** is a group of servers that are connected via a network that hold copies of your data. (MongoDB Atlas Clusters are used to store copies of your data.)

One of the advantages to using a MongoDB Atlas Cluster is that the configuration can change as your needs evolve. If you find that you need to add a region or move to a different cluster tier, those changes can be made easily!

Free and shared clusters can be deployed in a single geographical region, while dedicated clusters can be deployed across multiple geographical regions.

 Dedicated clusters provide access to all Atlas features. `M10+` dedicated clusters provide access to all Atlas features.
