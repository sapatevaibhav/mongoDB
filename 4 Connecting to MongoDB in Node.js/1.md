## Using MongoDB Node.js Client Libraries

When we connect an Application with MongoDB there is a middleware known as driver.

The Driver works in tandem with the built-in Node.js BSON package to interact with your MongoDB server.

MongoDB drivers establish secure connections to a MongoDB cluster and execute database operations on behalf of client applications.
