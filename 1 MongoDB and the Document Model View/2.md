## Document structure

MongoDB documents are displayed in *JSON* format, but stored in *BSON* format.

*BSON* supports additional data types, like dates, numbers, and ObjectIds.

BSON - Binary Javascript object notation.

ObjectId - A data type used to create unique indentifiers for the required _id field


## Flexible schema

MongoDB has a flexible schema model, which means that documents in the same collection are not required to share a common structure of fields and value types by default.

suppose we have to 3 fields in our database and later we want to modify the structure and want to add one more field in traditional RDBMS it was very complex due to MongoDB supports Flexible schema it is very easy as we just have to change the classes only

MongoDB Supports polymorphic data
We can use optional schema documentation if necessary.



Syntax:
```json
{
"key": value,
"key": value,
"key" : value
}
```

Example:

```json
{
"_id": 1,
"name": "AC3 Phone",
"colors" : ["black", "silver"],
"price" : 200,
"available" : true
}
```

The values in a document can be any data type, including strings, objects, arrays, booleans, nulls, dates, ObjectIds, and more!

Supported datatypes consists 32-bit integer, Object, Array, ObjectIds

_id is a required field not the datatype
