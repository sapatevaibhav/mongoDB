## How to use MongoDB connection String

This string allows us to connect to the cluster

We can use this string in either from Shell, Compass or Applications

There are two types of 
- Standard format
- DNS seed list format

### Standard format
used to connect to standalone clusters, replica sets, or sharded clusters.

### DNS Seed list format

Was introduced in v3.6

Provides a DNS server list to our connection String.
Gives us more flexibility of deployment.
Ability to change servers in rotation without reconfiguring clients.

String begins with required prefix `mongodb` to identify as MongoDB connection string

`+srv` Autometically sets TLS security option to true and tells mongo to use DNS seed list
Following MongoDB prefix there are fields for mongodb username and password.

Next is host and optional port number to our Database if port number is not specified MongoDB will use default port number `27017`

Final part is options we want to include like timeout, retryWrites

MongoDB provides a pre-formatted connection string to use with the `MongoDB Shell`. The connection string looks like the following:

```shell
mongosh "mongodb+srv://mdb-training-cluster.swnn5.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase" --apiVersion 1 --username MDBUser
```

MongoDB provides a pre-formatted connection string to use when connecting to `an application`. The connection string looks like the following:

```shell
mongodb+srv://MDBUser:<password>@mdb-training-cluster.swnn5.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majorit
```

MongoDB provides a pre-formatted connection string to use with `MongoDB Compass`. The connection string looks like the following:

```shell
mongodb+srv://MDBUser:<password>@mdb-training-cluster.swnn5.mongodb.net/test
```
